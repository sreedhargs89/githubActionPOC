# Pull Request Comment Management Workflow

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow for managing comments on pull requests. The workflow is triggered by various events related to pull requests and pull request comments.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow performs the following actions:

1. **Create or Update Comment:** When a pull request is opened or a comment is created/edited on the pull request, the workflow creates a new comment or updates an existing comment. The comment's content can be customized using Markdown to provide relevant information about the pull request.

2. **Delete Comment:** When the pull request is closed, the workflow deletes a specific comment associated with the pull request. This can be used to clean up any temporary or informational comments related to the pull request.

## Trigger Events

The workflow is triggered by the following events:

- Pull request opened
- Pull request synchronized (when changes are pushed to the pull request)
- Pull request comment created
- Pull request comment edited

## Prerequisites

To use this workflow, you need appropriate permissions to create, update, and delete comments on the repository.

## How to Use

1. Copy the contents of the `.github/workflows/pull_request_comments.yml` file from this repository into your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

2. The workflow uses the default GitHub token (`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`) for authentication, which has the necessary permissions for managing comments. There is no need to set up additional secrets.

3. Customize the comment's content in the workflow file according to your requirements. You can use Markdown to format the comment.

4. Once the workflow is set up, it will automatically manage comments on pull requests based on the specified events.

## Note

- Make sure to adjust the conditions, triggers, and actions in the workflow file according to your specific use case.

- You can also extend the workflow to trigger on other events, such as when specific labels are added to pull requests.
