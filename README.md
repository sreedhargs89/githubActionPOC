# GitHub Actions POC

## Introduction

This Readme provides an overview of GitHub Actions, its workflow, and architecture. GitHub Actions is a powerful continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform that automates various tasks, workflows, and processes within a GitHub repository.

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are a flexible and customizable way to automate tasks in your software development workflow. They enable developers to create workflows that automatically build, test, deploy, and perform other actions whenever certain events occur in a GitHub repository. These events can include push events, pull requests, issue comments, and more.

## Workflow

The workflow in GitHub Actions is a series of automated steps that are executed based on triggers defined by you. Each workflow is written in YAML format and is stored in a `.github/workflows` directory within your repository.

A typical workflow includes the following components:

1. **Event:** This is the trigger that initiates the workflow, such as a push to the repository, the creation of a pull request, or a scheduled event.

2. **Job:** A job is a collection of steps that run on the same runner. You can define one or more jobs in a workflow.

3. **Step:** A step is an individual task within a job. It can be a shell command, an action, or a combination of both.

4. **Action:** Actions are reusable units of code that can be combined to create workflows. They can be created by the GitHub community or custom-built for your specific needs.

5. **Runner:** A runner is a virtual machine that executes the job's steps. GitHub provides hosted runners, or you can use self-hosted runners to run workflows on your infrastructure.

6. **Artifact:** An artifact is a file or set of files produced during a workflow run, which can be used in subsequent jobs or downloaded as a build output.

7. **Workflow Visualization:** GitHub provides a visual representation of your workflow, making it easier to understand the flow and identify any issues.

## Architecture

GitHub Actions architecture is based on the following components:

1. **GitHub Platform:** The core platform that handles event triggers, manages workflows, and coordinates the runners.

2. **Runners:** Runners are virtual machines or containers that execute the jobs defined in your workflows. GitHub offers hosted runners with various configurations (Windows, macOS, Linux), or you can use self-hosted runners on your infrastructure.

3. **Workflow Files:** Workflows are defined in YAML files that reside in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. These files specify the events, jobs, and steps for automation.

4. **Actions:** Actions are the building blocks of workflows. They can be custom-developed or obtained from the GitHub Marketplace. Each action performs a specific task, and you can combine them to create powerful workflows.

5. **Runners Application:** This software is responsible for communication between the GitHub platform and the runners. It manages the job execution and reports the results back to GitHub.

6. **GitHub API:** The API facilitates communication between the GitHub platform and other services, allowing actions to interact with the repository, issues, pull requests, and more.

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions simplify and automate various aspects of the software development workflow, helping teams to be more productive and efficient. With the flexibility of defining custom workflows and utilizing pre-built actions, developers can focus more on writing code and less on repetitive tasks. The architecture behind GitHub Actions ensures seamless integration with the GitHub platform, making it a valuable tool for any software development project.
